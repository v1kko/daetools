The maintainer started publishing updates again, please use daetools from daetools.sourceforge.io!


Install
-------
Daetools is now available through a custom channel `conda.lipsum.eu` (self maintained)
```
conda create -n daetools -c https://conda.lipsum.eu -c conda-forge daetools python=3.9
```       

Before running the tutorials the plotter must be started separately due to a bug:
