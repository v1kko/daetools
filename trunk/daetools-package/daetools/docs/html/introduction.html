<h2>1.1. What is DAE Tools?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-dae-tools" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>DAE Tools</strong> is a collection of software tools for modelling, simulation and optimization
of real-world processes. Process modelling and simulation can be defined as theoretical
concepts and computational methods that describe, represent in a mathematical form and simulate
the functioning of real-world processes. <strong>DAE Tools</strong> is initially developed to model and
simulate processes in chemical process industry (mass, heat and momentum transfers, chemical
reactions, separation processes, thermodynamics). However, <strong>DAE Tools</strong> can help you develop
high-accuracy models of (in general) many different kind of processes/phenomena, simulate/optimize
them, visualize and analyse the results. Its features should be sufficient to enable mathematical
description of chemical, physical or socio/economic phenomena. The most common are initial value
problems of implicit form, which can be formulated as systems of linear, non-linear, and (partial)
differential algebraic equations.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="programming-paradigms">
<h2>1.2. Programming paradigms<a class="headerlink" href="#programming-paradigms" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In general, there are two types of approaches that can be applied to process modelling:
Domain Specific Language approach and a general-purpose programming language approach (such as
c/c++, Java or Python). A Domain Specific Language (DSL) is a special-purpose programming or
specification language dedicated to a particular problem domain and so designed that it directly
supports the key concepts necessary to describe the underlying problems. A domain-specific
language is created specifically to solve problems in a particular domain and is usually not
intended to be able to solve problems outside it (although that may be technically possible in
some cases). In contrast, general-purpose languages are created to solve problems in a wide
variety of application domains.</p>
<p>Domain-specific languages are languages with very specific goals in design and implementation and
commonly lack low-level functions for filesystem access, interprocess control, and other functions
that characterize full-featured programming languages, scripting or otherwise.</p>
<p>A good example of general purpose (multi-domain) domain specific language is <a class="reference external" href="http://www.modelica.org">Modelica</a>
while single-domain (chemical processing industry related) DSLs are <a class="reference external" href="http://www.psenterprise.com/gproms">gPROMS</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="http://ascend4.org">Ascend</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.aspentech.com">SpeedUp</a> etc.</p>
<p>DAE Tools approach is a sort of the hybrid approach: it applies general-purpose programming languages
such as c++ and Python, but offers a class-hierarchy/API that resembles a syntax of a DSL as much as
possible, an access to the low-level functions, large number of standard and third party libraries and
uses state of the art free/open-source software components to accomplish particular tasks (calculating
derivatives and sensitivities, solving systems of differential and algebraic systems of equations and
optimization problems, processing and plotting results etc).</p>

<h2>1.3. Model development<a class="headerlink" href="#model-development" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In general, three approaches to process modelling exist (<a class="footnote-reference" href="#morton2003" id="id1">[1]</a>):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Sequential Modular (<strong>SeqM</strong>) approach</li>
<li>Simultaneous Modular (<strong>SimM</strong>) approach</li>
<li>Equation-Oriented (<strong>EO</strong>) approach</li>
</ul>
<p>The pros &amp; cons of the first two approaches are extensively studied in the literature. Under the <strong>EO</strong> approach we generate
and gather together all equations and variables which constitute the model representing the process. The equations are solved
simultaneously using a suitable mathematical algorithm (Morton, 2003 <a class="footnote-reference" href="#morton2003" id="id2">[1]</a>). Equation-oriented simulation requires
simultaneous solution of a set of differential algebraic equations (<strong>DAE</strong>) which itself requires a solution of a set of
nonlinear algebraic equations (<strong>NLAE</strong>) and linear algebraic equations (<strong>LAE</strong>). The Newton&#8217;s method or some variant of it
is almost always used to solve problems described by NLAEs. A brief history of Equation-Oriented solvers and comparison of
<strong>SeqM</strong> and <strong>EO</strong> approaches as well as descriptions of the simultaneous modular and equation-oriented methods can be found
in Morton, 2003 (<a class="footnote-reference" href="#morton2003" id="id3">[1]</a>). Also a good overview of the equation-oriented approach and its application in
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.psenterprise.com/gproms">gPROMS</a> is given by Barton &amp; Pantelides (<a class="footnote-reference" href="#pantelides1" id="id5">[2]</a>, <a class="footnote-reference" href="#pantelides2" id="id6">[3]</a>, <a class="footnote-reference" href="#pantelides3" id="id7">[4]</a>).</p>
<p><strong>DAE Tools</strong> use the Equation-Oriented approach to process modelling, and the following types of processes can be modelled:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Lumped and distributed</li>
<li>Steady-state and dynamic</li>
</ul>
<p>Problems can be formulated as linear, non-linear, and (partial) differential algebraic systems (of index 1).
The most common problems are initial value problems of implicit form. Equations can be ordinary or discontinuous,
where discontinuities are automatically handled by the framework. A good overview of discontinuous equations and
a procedure for location of equation discontinuities is given by Park &amp; Barton (<a class="footnote-reference" href="#parkbarton" id="id8">[5]</a>)
and in <a class="reference external" href="https://computation.llnl.gov/casc/sundials/documentation/ida_guide/node3.html#SECTION00330000000000000000documentation">Sundials IDA</a>

<h2>1.4. The main features<a class="headerlink" href="#the-main-features" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>DAE Tools</strong> is a cross-platform equation-oriented process modelling and optimization system. All core libraries
are written in standard ANSI/ISO c++ . It is highly portable - it can run on every platform with a decent c++ compiler,
Boost and standard c/c++ libraries (by now it is tested on 32/64 bit x86 and ARM architectures making it suitable for
use in embedded systems). <strong>DAE Tools</strong> core libraries are small and fast, and each module can be easily extended.
Models can be developed in Python (<strong>pyDAE</strong> module) or c++ (<strong>cDAE</strong> module), compiled into an independent
executable and deployed without a need for any run time libraries.</p>
<p>Various types of processes (lumped or distributed, steady-state or dynamic) can be modelled and optimized. They may
range from very simple to those which require complex operating procedures. Equations can be ordinary or discontinuous,
where discontinuities are automatically handled by the framework. Model reports  containing all information about
a model can be exported in XML MathML format automatically creating a high quality documentation. The simulation
results can be visualized, plotted and/or exported into various formats.</p>
<p>Currently <a class="reference external" href="https://computation.llnl.gov/casc/sundials/main.html">Sundials IDAS</a> solver is used to solve DAE systems
and calculate sensitivities, while <a class="reference external" href="https://projects.coin-or.org/Bonmin">BONMIN</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="https://projects.coin-or.org/IPOPT">IPOPT</a>,
and <a class="reference external" href="http://ab-initio.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/NLopt">NLOPT</a> solvers are used to solve NLP/MINLP problems.
<strong>DAE Tools</strong> support direct dense and sparse matrix linear solvers (sequential and multi-threaded versions)
at the moment. In addition to the built-in Sundials linear solvers, several third party libraries are interfaced:
<a class="reference external" href="http://crd.lbl.gov/~xiaoye/SuperLU/index.html">SuperLU/SuperLU_MT</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="http://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-mkl">Intel Pardiso</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amd.com/acml">AMD ACML</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="http://trilinos.sandia.gov/packages/amesos/">Trilinos Amesos</a> (KLU, Umfpack, SuperLU, Lapack),
and <a class="reference external" href="http://trilinos.sandia.gov/packages/aztecoo">Trilinos AztecOO</a> (with built-in, Ifpack or ML preconditioners)
which can take advantage of multi-core/cpu computers. Linear solvers that exploit general-purpose graphics processing
units (<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPGPU">GPGPU</a>, such as <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_home_new.html">NVidia CUDA</a>)
are also available ([[SuperLU_CUDA]], <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/cusp-library">CUSP</a>) but in an early development stage.</p>
<p>DAE Tools models can be exported into some other modelling languages. At the moment, models can be exported into
pyDAE (python) and cDAE (c++) but other languages will be supported in the future (such as OpenModelica, EMSO ...).</p>

<div class="section" id="programming-language">
<h2>1.6. Programming language<a class="headerlink" href="#programming-language" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>DAE Tools</strong> core libraries are written in standard c++. However, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> programming language is
used as the main modelling language. The main reason for use of Python is (as the authors say):
<em>&#8220;Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple
but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python&#8217;s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its
interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on
most platforms&#8221;</em> <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial">link</a>.</p>
<p>And: &#8220;<em>Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased productivity it provides. Since there is no
compilation step, the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast&#8221;</em> <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/doc/essays/blurb">link</a>. Also, please
have a look on <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/doc/essays/comparisons">a comparison to the other languages</a>. Based on the information
available online, and according to the personal experience, the python programs are much shorter and take an order of magnitude
less time to develop it. Initially I developed daePlotter module in c++; it took me about one month of part time coding. But,
then I moved to python: reimplementing it in PyQt took me just two days (with several new features added), while the code size
shrank from 24 cpp modules to four python modules only!</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Where Python code is typically 3-5 times shorter than equivalent Java code, it is often 5-10 times shorter than equivalent
C++ code! Anecdotal evidence suggests that one Python programmer can finish in two months what two C++ programmers can&#8217;t
complete in a year. Python shines as a glue language, used to combine components written in C++&#8221;</em>
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/doc/essays/comparisons">link</a>.
Obviously, not everything can be developed in python; for complex projects I still prefer the heavy c++ artillery.</p>

The early ideas of starting a project like this go back into 2007. At that time I have been working on my
PhD thesis using one of commercially available process modelling software. It was everything nice and well
until I discovered some annoying bugs and lack of certain highly appreciated features. The developers of that
proprietary program (as it is a case with all proprietary computer programs) had their own agenda fixing only
what they wanted to fix and introducing new features that they anticipated. Although I was able to improve
the code and introduce certain features which will help (not only) me - I was helpless. The source code was
not available and nobody will ever consider giving it to me to create patches with bugs fixes/new features.
Not even if I swear on the holy (c++) bible!!
Very soon the contours of a new process modelling software slowly began to form. It took me a while until
I made a definite plan and initial features, and I had to abandon a couple of initial versions...</p>
