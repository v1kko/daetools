<span id="hybrid-approach"></span><h2>2.1. The Hybrid approach<a class="headerlink" href="#the-hybrid-approach" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In general, there are two types of approaches that can be applied to process modelling:
Domain Specific Language approach and a general-purpose programming language approach (such as
c/c++, Java or Python). A Domain Specific Language (DSL) is a special-purpose programming or
specification language dedicated to a particular problem domain and so designed that it directly
supports the key concepts necessary to describe the underlying problems. A domain-specific
language is created specifically to solve problems in a particular domain and is usually not
intended to be able to solve problems outside it (although that may be technically possible in
some cases). In contrast, general-purpose languages are created to solve problems in a wide
variety of application domains.</p>
<p>Domain-specific languages are languages with very specific goals in design and implementation and
commonly lack low-level functions for filesystem access, interprocess control, and other functions
that characterize full-featured programming languages, scripting or otherwise.</p>
<p>A good example of general purpose (multi-domain) domain specific language is <a class="reference external" href="http://www.modelica.org">Modelica</a>
while single-domain (chemical processing industry related) DSLs are <a class="reference external" href="http://www.psenterprise.com/gproms">gPROMS</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="http://ascend4.org">Ascend</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.aspentech.com">SpeedUp</a> etc.</p>
<p><strong>DAE Tools</strong> approach is a sort of the hybrid approach: it applies general-purpose programming languages
such as c++ and Python, but offers a class-hierarchy/API that resembles a syntax of a DSL as much as
possible, an access to the low-level functions, large number of standard and third party libraries and
uses state of the art free/open-source software components to accomplish particular tasks (calculating
derivatives and sensitivities, solving systems of differential and algebraic systems of equations and
optimization problems, processing and plotting results etc).</p>

<p><strong>DAE Tools</strong> provide low-level concepts such as parameters, variables, equations, ports, models,
state transition networks, discrete events etc. so that the key concepts from new application domains
can be added on top of those low level concepts. For instance, the key modelling concepts from the
simulator-independent xml-based domain specific language for modelling of biological neural
networks <a class="reference external" href="http://software.incf.org/software/nineml">NineML</a> such as neurones, synapses, connectivity
patterns, populations of neurones, projections etc. are based on <strong>DAE Tools</strong> low-level concepts.</p>

<span id="equation-oriented-approach"></span><h2>2.2. The Equation-Oriented approach<a class="headerlink" href="#the-equation-oriented-approach" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In general, three approaches to process modelling exist (<a class="footnote-reference" href="#morton2003" id="id3">[1]</a>):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Sequential Modular (<strong>SeqM</strong>) approach</li>
<li>Simultaneous Modular (<strong>SimM</strong>) approach</li>
<li>Equation-Oriented (<strong>EO</strong>) approach</li>
</ul>
<p>The pros &amp; cons of the first two approaches are extensively studied in the literature. Under the <strong>EO</strong> approach we generate
and gather together all equations and variables which constitute the model representing the process. The equations are solved
simultaneously using a suitable mathematical algorithm (Morton, 2003 <a class="footnote-reference" href="#morton2003" id="id4">[1]</a>). Equation-oriented simulation requires
simultaneous solution of a set of differential algebraic equations (<strong>DAE</strong>) which itself requires a solution of a set of
nonlinear algebraic equations (<strong>NLAE</strong>) and linear algebraic equations (<strong>LAE</strong>). The Newton&#8217;s method or some variant of it
is almost always used to solve problems described by NLAEs. A brief history of Equation-Oriented solvers and comparison of
<strong>SeqM</strong> and <strong>EO</strong> approaches as well as descriptions of the simultaneous modular and equation-oriented methods can be found
in Morton, 2003 (<a class="footnote-reference" href="#morton2003" id="id5">[1]</a>). Also a good overview of the equation-oriented approach and its application in
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.psenterprise.com/gproms">gPROMS</a> is given by Barton &amp; Pantelides (<a class="footnote-reference" href="#pantelides1" id="id7">[2]</a>, <a class="footnote-reference" href="#pantelides2" id="id8">[3]</a>, <a class="footnote-reference" href="#pantelides3" id="id9">[4]</a>).</p>
<p><strong>DAE Tools</strong> use the Equation-Oriented approach to process modelling, and the following types of processes can be modelled:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Lumped and distributed</li>
<li>Steady-state and dynamic</li>
</ul>
<p>Problems can be formulated as linear, non-linear, and (partial) differential algebraic systems (of index 1).
The most common problems are initial value problems of implicit form. Equations can be ordinary or discontinuous,
where discontinuities are automatically handled by the framework. A good overview of discontinuous equations and
a procedure for location of equation discontinuities is given by Park &amp; Barton (<a class="footnote-reference" href="#parkbarton" id="id10">[5]</a>)
and in <a class="reference external" href="https://computation.llnl.gov/casc/sundials/documentation/ida_guide/node3.html#SECTION00330000000000000000documentation">Sundials IDA</a>

<p>The Object-Oriented approach to process modelling is adopted in <strong>DAE Tools</strong>.
The main characteristics of such an approach are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Everything is an object</li>
<li>Models are classes derived from the base daeModel class</li>
<li>Basically all OO concepts supported by the target language (c++, Python) are allowed,
except few exceptions:
* Multiple inheritance is supported
* Models can be parametrized (using templates in c++)
* Derived classes always inherit all declared parameters, variables, equations etc. (polymorphism achieved through virtual functions where the declaration takes place)
* All parameters, variables, equations etc. remain public</li>
<li>Hierarchical model decomposition</li>

<div class="section" id="programming-language">
<span id="python-programming-language"></span><h2>2.4. Programming language<a class="headerlink" href="#programming-language" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>DAE Tools</strong> core libraries are written in standard c++. However, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> programming language is
used as the main modelling language. The main reason for use of Python is (as the authors say):
&#8220;<em>Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple
but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python&#8217;s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its
interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on
most platforms</em>&#8221; <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial">link</a>.</p>
<p>And: <em>&#8220;Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased productivity it provides. Since there is no
compilation step, the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast</em>&#8221; <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/doc/essays/blurb">link</a>. Also, please
have a look on <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/doc/essays/comparisons">a comparison to the other languages</a>. Based on the information
available online, and according to the personal experience, the python programs are much shorter and take an order of magnitude
less time to develop it. Initially I developed daePlotter module in c++; it took me about one month of part time coding. But,
then I moved to python: reimplementing it in PyQt took me just two days (with several new features added), while the code size
shrank from 24 cpp modules to four python modules only!</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>Where Python code is typically 3-5 times shorter than equivalent Java code, it is often 5-10 times shorter than equivalent
C++ code! Anecdotal evidence suggests that one Python programmer can finish in two months what two C++ programmers can&#8217;t
complete in a year. Python shines as a glue language, used to combine components written in C++</em>&#8221;
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/doc/essays/comparisons">link</a>.
Obviously, not everything can be developed in python; a heavy c++ artillery is still necessary for highly complex projects.</p>
